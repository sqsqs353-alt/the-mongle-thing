<h2>Billy Bob Part 1.</h2>
Billy Bob is playing outside when he is 6 years old when he accidentally lights a fire in his backyard. His grandma, Martha, comes out of the house and tries to stomp the fire out. The thing is, Martha was wearing her bunny slippers made out of cotton. So Martha caught on fire, and she started running. She stepped on a gigasizer and became a giant. Martha keeps running and steps on Greenland and she melts some of the ice off. Then she stepped on the shrinkray and became the size of an atom. I wonder what happened to her. (THIS IS NOT THE END). Then little Timmy stepped on Martha and Martha ascended to heaven.
